## Bot Permissions Needed

When inviting the bot to your server, make sure to grant these permissions:
- Send Messages

- Embed Links
- Attach Files (for image uploads and downloads)

## Troubleshooting

- **Bot not responding**: Check if Ollama is running and the "myai-bot" channel exists
- **API errors**: Verify Ollama is accessible at the configured URL
- **Image generation not working**: Ensure ComfyUI is running on port 8188 with required models
- **Video generation not working**: Ensure ComfyUI has video models loaded (wan2.1_t2v, umt5_xxl, wan_2.1_vae)
- **Music generation not working**: Ensure ComfyUI has audio models loaded (ace_step_v1_3.5b.safetensors)
- **Image analysis not working**: Use a vision model like `!llm llava`
- **Permission errors**: Ensure the bot has proper permissions in the channel
- **Large files failing**: Keep images under 5MB and audio/video under 8MB for optimal processing
